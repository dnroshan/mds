msd [pronounced /m.s.d/] (or µsd [pronounced /micro.s.d/])
stand for “micro-display server”. It is a toy project of a
display server with an architecture resembling that of a
microkernel.

The reason for having a display server architectured as a
microkernel is so that components of the display server
can be replaced online. That is, when you install a newer
version of the display server you can start running the
new version without having to restart the display server.
Moreover, it allows you to replace components with your
own versions or add new components, with exception of
parts that need the special privileges and one special
component, the program that starts it all, but that file
will have no mission except restarting the master server
if it crashes once it has started the master server.

Is this vaporware? Probably I often bored with graphical
projects. Graphics sucks.
