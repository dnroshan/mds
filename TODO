Fast lanes
Optimise use of mutexe by replace them with rwlocks
Listen for `Command: reregister`
Register protocols
Make it possible to forbid unauthorised servers for listening, needed for secure password fields
  I guess we can let servers create their own abstract sockets, report them to mdsinitrc and
  let mdsinitrc export appropriate environment variables.
A facility is needed to lookup available compose sequences to any character,
  it would be useful in character map programs so one can easier learn the
  compose sequences for character that one uses often
Servers should be stored in LIBEXECDIR.
Implement reconnect_to_display()

src/libmdsserver/config.h should be sed:ed rather than use #ifndef
