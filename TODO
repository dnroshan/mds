Fast lanes
Optimise use of mutexe by replace them with rwlocks
Listen for `Command: reregister`
Register protocols
A facility is needed to lookup available compose sequences to any character,
  it would be useful in character map programs so one can easier learn the
  compose sequences for character that one uses often
Servers should be stored in LIBEXECDIR.
Implement reconnect_to_display()

Something is up with the test, it does not exit on Control+C
