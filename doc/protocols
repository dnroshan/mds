Command: assign-id
  Assign new ID to client, or fetch current ID

Purpose: assigning ID to clients so server can respond to that client

Compulsivity: manditory (core infrastructure)

More documentation: doc/messages

Reference implementation: mds-server

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Command: intercept
  Sign up for reception of message

Optional header: Stop
  Stop reception of messages if `yes`

Optional header: Priority
  Signed 64-bit integer of reception priority (reversed of order)

Optional header: Modifying
  Send message asynchronously and await modification if `yes`

Optional header: Length
  Length of the message

Message: list of headers and headerâ€“value-pairs that qualifies
         a message for reception, all messages qualifies if this
	 list is empty

Purpose: filter received message for clients and servers
Purpose: assigned interception order for modification of messages

Compulsivity: manditory (core infrastructure)

More documentation: doc/messages

Reference implementation: mds-server

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Command: echo
  Echo back a message

Required header: Client ID
  Your ID, provided by `ID assignment`
  in response to `Command: assign-id`
  
Optional header: Length
  Length of the message

Message: message to echo

Purpose: debugging and testing
Purpose: network heartbeat

Compulsivity: recommended for network enabled servers

Reference implementation: mds-echo

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Command: register
  Register availability of a command for which you implement a service

Required header: Client ID
  Your ID, provided by `ID assignment`
  in response to `Command: assign-id`

Conditionally required header: Length
  Required if: `Action: list`
  Length of the message

Optional header: Action
  Remove availability for registry if `remove`.
  Wait until listed commands are available if `wait`,
    however if a protocol becomes unavailable during this
    wait period it will still be counted as available for
    this wait action.
  Send a list of availability commands if `list`.

Conditionally optional header: Time to live
  Available and optional if: `Action: wait`
  The maximum number of seconds to wait.

Message: List of values for the header `Command` that you implement

Purpose: Identify supported display server operations
Purpose: Initialisation process synchronisation

Compulsivity: highly recommended (infrastructure), programs may
	      stall a bit from time to time without it, or at
	      initialisation depending on the program's implementation

Reference implementation: mds-registry

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Command: reregister
  Request that all servers resends `Command: register` with either
  `Action: add` or without the `Action` header (does the same thing)

Purpose: Rebuild registry created with `Command: register` if the
	 registry server crashes

Compulsivity: highly recommended (infrastructure), programs may
	      think a protocol is not supported of the registry
	      server crashes if you do not implement this in your
	      server

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Command: clipboard
  Read or manipulate a clipboard

Required header: Level
  The clipboard level, an [1, 3] integer:
    1 "primary".    Text copied/pasted using
      		    the keyboard or a menu item
    2 "secondary".  Text copied/pasted using the rat
    3 "tertiary".   Non-text, it is customary for this
      		    data to begin with a line describing
		    the data type.

Required header: Action
  What to do with the clipboard:
    add)  Write the message to the clipboard
    read)  Read the clipboard
    clear)  Clear all entries on the selected level on the clipboard
    set-size)  Shrink/grow the clipstack
    get-size)  Read the size of the clipstack
      In the reply, the server will send:
	Size: <configured maximum size of the clipstack>
	Used: <number of elements currently in the clipstack>

Conditionally required header: Length
  Required if: `Action: add`
  Length of the message

Conditionally required header: Size
  Required if: `Action: set-size`
  The maximum number of elements in the clipstack

Conditionally required header: Client ID
  Your ID, provided by `ID assignment`
  in response to `Command: assign-id`.
  Required if: `Action: add` and a header starting with
  	       `Time to live: until-death`
  Required if: `Action: read`
  Required if: `Action: get-size`

Conditionally optional header: Index
  Available and optional if: `Action: read`
  The index of the item in the clipstack, starting at 0

Conditionally optional header: Time to live
  Available and optional if: `Action: add`
  The number of seconds the entry should be available
  before it is removed by the server, or:
    until-death: remove entry when the client closes
    until-death #: remove entry when the client closes,
    		   or # seconds have elapsed
    forever: never remove it (default)
  The server will always remove the entry when:
    1) it is at the bottom of the clipstack and a new
       entry is added to the clipstack
    2) `Action: clear` is issued for the clipstack
  The entry will also be removed, unless
  `Time to live: forever`, if the server crashes or is
  reexecuted.
  It is up to the implementation to choose when
  the removal actually takes place. For example,
  the reference implementation will pop entries
  that have timed out when a new entry is added,
  the reading on the clipstack is requested or the
  server is reexecuted, but another implement may
  choose to pop entires asynchronously using another
  thread or an alarm an pop when when SIGARLM is
  received.

Message: The content to add to the clipboard

Purpose: Enable the user to duplicate content from one process
	 into another process without requiring those processes
	 to be aware of eathother to any extent

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Command: clipboard-info

      Used:    Number of elements currently in the clipstack
  crash)  The clipboard has been reset because of a software crash
